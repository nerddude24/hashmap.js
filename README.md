# hashmap.js

A lightweight working implementation of HashMaps and HashSets in JS.

## Testing

You can test it by cloning the repo, and running:

`node test.js` for hashmap test
or `node test_hashset.js` for hashset.

or do whatever you want with it!

## linked-list.js ?

I used my own linked list implementation which you can find [here](https://github.com/nerddude24/linked-list.js).
